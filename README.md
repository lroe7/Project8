# Project 8 - Numerical Integration
 The purpose of this assignment is to develop a tool to numerically evaluate a Riemann integral of a function and to calculate the amount of data transferred over a network. 
## How to run the program
- download the zip file 
- make sure you have python 3.8 and pip 3 installed
- get the necessary libraries by using the command "pip install [library]" for numpy, scipy, and matplotlib
